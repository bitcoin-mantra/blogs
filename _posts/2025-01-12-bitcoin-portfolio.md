BTC Investing **Strategy:**
---------------------------

![Bitcoin Allocation](https://bitcoin-mantra.github.io/blogs/assets/img3/BitcoinAllocation.png)

**Step#1** **BTC Investment %age:** Calculate **5%** of your total investment portfolio you want to invest into BTC in any given year.

**Step#2** **DCA:** Instead of waiting for BTC prices to dip, start daily dollar-cost averaging (DCA). It's natural for people to overanalyze price movements and market sentiment, but consistency is key. However, Bitcoin drawdowns of 30% to 70% have occurred in past and it makes sense to buy in larger chunks. Every price drop is a great opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price.

**Step#3 Holding Period:** Keep accumulating (HODL) for 4 to 5 years to ride through the next halving cycle. Historically, it takes approximately 6 to 12 months after a halving for the bull cycle to begin. With the next halving expected in March 2028, it’s wise to continue accumulating at least until January 2029.

> **Note:** I'm flexible with Step #1 and Step #2, as they can be adjusted based on individual investor risk appetite. However, the Step #3 accumulation period must remain fixed. This is where the real magic happens. Even seasoned investors struggle to time the market, so it's best not to overthink it.

**Example:**
------------

-   Let's assume investor earning **in USA as $100K and in India ₹10 lakh** for simplification in calculations.

-   Next halving cycle lets make some prediction assumption, for **bear, crab(neutral) or bull** market scenarios (this number might differ but I am taking some avg. estimates). Considering BTC avg. price during writing of this article **Jan 2025 is b/w $90K and $100K.**

-   As we are DCA bitcoin everyday, so avg. accumulation for our example is **0.2 BTC (for USA) and 0.02 (for India)**. Now, lets see the profits after next halving cycle (2028 - 2029) for different type of markets.

**Note**: As per estimates, BTC is still growing avg. 50% to 60%, after 10 to 15 years it'll surely reduce to 20%. So, achieving **50%, 150% or 400%** in 4 years seems possible w.r.t to different kind of market (it's safe estimate).

**Conclusion**: There’s a good chance that, in a bullish scenario after four years, **$20K** could grow to **$100K**. For an Indian investor, this could mean their **₹2 lakh** turning into **₹10 lakh**.

Please feel free to look at original [Excel Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15CVooI68gb2pkhi9sLaZW7SmJjocTeD-VEgMc-HuZ8g/edit?usp=sharing) I used for above example, you can copy and make changes to any number or calculations per your customized portfolio.

**Comparing Global Market & How much money might enter into BTC in coming future?**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's take help from our teachers to guide us here, 1st is **Michael Saylor** explaining total global wealth vs various asset classes recently during Microsoft Investor conference. $**900 T** global wealth and current **BTC** is just **$2T** market cap. 

![](https://vinaybaatcheet.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/screenshot-2025-01-13-at-12.07.13e280afam.png?w=1024)

Our 2nd teacher is Canadian Bitcoin maxi **Greg Foss** explaining us about probability of **BTC to reach b/w $200K** and **$2M** few years back. Greg brilliantly explained the bear case (90% probability) and the bull case (10% probability), stating that BTC reaching $200K is inevitable—it’s just math. However, he didn’t predict when it would happen, as this content was published few years ago. If you adjust the probabilities between bear and bull markets, BTC’s price could realistically land between $200K and $2M.

These pics were taken 13 years apart. Same place 5th Av. NY City. Year 1900, on the left horse carriages and 1 car. On the right, 1 horse carriage and all the cars clicked during 1913.

**Conclusion:**
---------------
Transitions are often difficult to recognize while they’re happening, but everyone sees them once they’re complete. Now, could the current banking industry or fiat system be replaced by a superior form of global money?

**Bitcoin** is running solid and strong **24/7** since **2009** without any centralized control. This is reminding me about **M. Saylor famous phrase:** 

> **Bitcoin** is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the **goddess of wisdom**, feeding on the **fire of truth**, exponentially growing ever **smarter, faster, and stronger.**

Time will ultimately reveal the accuracy of this math, and speculation is up to each individual. My goal is to learn from others and share my insights with the investing community.

 This is my effort to break down these topics and provide actionable steps for my readers. None of this would be possible without the constant support and encouragement of my **family and friends**. I often share my ideas with them and ask for feedback to make sure these articles are truly helpful.

> **Keep LEARNing, Keep STACKing & Keep HODLing!!!**

I have fair assumption that once our portfolio clear 4 to 5 years **gravitation pull** of investment cycle, then you can relax and find a new gig!
