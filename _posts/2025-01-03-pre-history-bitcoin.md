# Part#1: ₿(Bitcoin's) History And Pre-history

## Bitcoin vs Banks
Bitcoin is the **first** decentralized cryptocurrency, utilizing blockchain technology to facilitate peer-to-peer digital transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks. Traditionally we are dependent on Banks to settle any monetary transaction and maintain the  record keeping or ledger.

Banks have several drawbacks like centralization, high fees, slow, limited accessibility, account freezing risks, and lack of transparency. Unlike banks, which rely on intermediaries and are subject to government control, Bitcoin operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to transact freely without restrictions. Bitcoin’s limited supply protects against inflation, while banks can print money and devaluing currency over time. 

Bitcoin is the result of **40 years** of work by cryptographers and computer scientists known as **cypherpunks**. As of Nov 2024, there were 25,000+ other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, out of them several are either dead or of no-use.

## Different actors in the Bitcoin Ecosystem

**Miners** use computational power to solve complex mathematical puzzles (Proof-of-Work) and validate transactions. In return, they earn newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees. Mining secures the network by preventing fraudulent transactions and double-spending.

**Developers** contribute to Bitcoin’s open-source code, proposing and implementing improvements. They ensure network efficiency, security updates, and scalability solutions. However, they cannot enforce changes without community consensus.

**Nodes** store and verify the entire blockchain ledger, ensuring transaction validity without relying on miners. Full nodes enforce Bitcoin’s rules, reject invalid transactions, and contribute to network decentralization.

**Stakeholders** Holders of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency. This includes people who have bought it as a cryptocurrency investment and who plan to use it for payments. 

So, Miners secure the network, developers improve functionality, and nodes enforce protocol rules. This decentralized collaboration ensures Bitcoin remains secure and transparent financial system without any central authority control.

## Bitcoin Price w.r.t Time and Milestones achieved so-far... (Bitcoin Halving?)

### What is Bitcoin Halving?
Bitcoin halving is a built-in mechanism that reduces miners' rewards by half every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, ensuring Bitcoin’s controlled supply.

**Original Source:**[Link to Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1gqafju/bitcoin_has_followed_a_consistent_4year_cycle_for/?rdt=63663)

### Milestones:
- **Reached $1: February 2011** Bitcoin gained initial recognition and crossed the $1 mark during early adoption.

- **Reached $100: April 2013** Increased interest from tech enthusiasts and early investors drove the price upward.

- **Reached $1,000: November 2013** Fueled by speculative interest, it briefly crossed $1,000 before facing a significant correction.

- **Reached $10,000: November 2017** Bitcoin's surge was driven by institutional interest, increased adoption, and global media coverage.

- **Reached $100,000: December 2024** Reaching $100K milestone on Dec 5 is breaking a psychological level, registered in history after the 4th halving and spot BTC ETF approvals within USA.

### ETA for Future Milestones

**$1,000,000**: $1M Optimistic forecasts suggest the possibility between 2030 and 2040, driven by scarcity (fixed supply of 21 million BTC) and institutional acceptance as digital gold.

**NOTE** These projections depend heavily on market conditions, regulatory developments, and global economic factors. Bitcoin remains volatile and speculative.

## Pre-History:
### 40 years of several attempts made to create cryptocurrencies before Bitcoin:

### 1. DigiCash
Creator: David Chaum
Year of Creation: 1989

**Drawbacks**:
- Centralized: DigiCash required a trusted third party to process transactions
- Lack of adoption: Limited interest from banks and institutions led to its failure.
Bankruptcy: DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998.

### 2. e-gold
Creator: Douglas Jackson and Barry Downey
Year of Creation: 1996

**Drawbacks:**
- Centralized: Controlled by a single entity, making it susceptible to legal actions.
- Legal issues: It was shut down in 2009 after being linked to money laundering.

### 3. Hashcash
Creator: **Adam Back**
Year of Creation: 1997

**Drawbacks:**
- Limited functionality: Originally designed to prevent email spam, not as a currency.
- No blockchain: It lacked a ledger system to record and verify transactions.
- Inefficient scaling: Computational costs made it impractical for widespread use.

### 4. b-money
Creator: Wei Dai
Year of Proposal: 1998
**Drawbacks**:
- Never implemented: It remained a theoretical proposal and was never deployed.
- No robust consensus: Lacked a practical mechanism to achieve distributed consensus like Bitcoin's proof-of-work.

### 5. Bit Gold
Creator: Nick Szabo
Year of Proposal: 1998

**Drawbacks:**
- No implementation: Like b-money, it was never fully realized.
- Lack of incentives: Did not have a built-in reward system for miners like Bitcoin.
- No global ledger: Did not use a blockchain to prevent double-spending.

Bitcoin improved upon these attempts by introducing a decentralized blockchain, robust proof-of-work consensus, pseudonymity, and a self-sustaining incentive structure for miners, which resolved many of the drawbacks of earlier systems.

### How many Bitcoin does its inventor Satoshi Nakamoto still own?
In the first seven months of Bitcoin's existence, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto mined as many as **1.1 million** Bitcoin (out of total **21 million** coins). Satoshi's coins have never been spent or moved from their original mining addresses known as "Patoshi Blocks". 

Despite multiple bull runs, these coins remain untouched, except for a small 10 BTC test transaction sent to **Hal Finney**, whom some speculate to be Satoshi. Bitcoin operates on an open ledger, allowing anyone to verify Satoshi’s coins, making Bitcoin even scarcer than commonly perceived. 

Satoshi has given Bitcoin as a best gift to humanity and avoided any personal financial gain. We can also say that this is a test of Bitcoin’s integrity, if Satoshi coins ever move, it will cause a significant stir in the community.
